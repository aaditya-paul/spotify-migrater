## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Spotify Developer account
- Two Spotify accounts (source and target)

### 1. Create a Spotify App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click "Create app"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **App name**: Spotify Migrater
   - **App description**: Migrate Spotify library between accounts
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000/api/callback`
   - **APIs used**: Web API
4. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/callback
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret_here
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Spotify app credentials.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Connect Source Account**: Click "Connect Source Account" and log in with your source Spotify account
2. **Connect Target Account**: Click "Connect Target Account" and log in with your target Spotify account
3. **Start Migration**: Once both accounts are connected, click "üöÄ Start Migration"
4. **Wait for Completion**: The migration will process all your data. This may take a few minutes depending on your library size
5. **View Results**: See the summary of migrated items (songs, playlists, albums, artists)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend

- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **React 19** for UI components
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling

### Backend (Serverless API Routes)

- `/api/auth` - Initiates OAuth flow
- `/api/callback` - Handles OAuth callback
- `/api/user` - Fetches user information
- `/api/migrate` - Performs the migration
- `/api/logout` - Disconnects accounts

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks connect button
2. Redirected to Spotify OAuth page
3. User grants permissions
4. Callback receives authorization code
5. Exchange code for access/refresh tokens
6. Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies

### Migration Process

1. Fetch all items from source account (liked songs, playlists, albums, artists)
2. Create equivalent items in target account
3. Handle API rate limits with batching
4. Return migration summary

## üîí Security

- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- No passwords stored
- Tokens expire automatically

## üåê Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel
